Today is the first Monday of spring break, and it is going bog-standard, feeling pretty much like the past few weeks, just staying at home.  I was working on math, and I got roughly half of Khan Academy's high school geometry course done today, so not to bad in terms of progression, but a rather dry day.  I will get to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 today, so maybe some entertainment.
